Project Goal:
The primary objective of our testing project is to build a comprehensive, automated test suite for Reddit’s core features—both API endpoints and UI workflows—to ensure functional correctness, detect regressions early, and improve overall system reliability. By validating operations such as post creation, user management, content sorting, messaging, notifications, and account settings, we aim to: 

Verify that each feature behaves according to specification under positive and negative scenarios. 

Prevent critical defects from reaching production by catching them during CI runs. 

Provide clear, repeatable test artifacts that support continuous integration and future development.
